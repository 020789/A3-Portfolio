  		<h3>1. Dust Bunnies Animation</h3>
	  		<p>
	        As a team of five we were tasked to create an 3D animated film. My role
	        on this project was mainly animating, rigging, and some 3d modeling.
	        Dust Bunnies is an animated short about a lonesome dust bunny named
	        Dustin, who lives in a corner of an apartment. He dreams of being
	        vacuumed by the apartment's vacuum cleaner, Roomba, however, due to a
	        thumbtack being stuck on Dustin’s head, Roomba refuses to vacuum him out
	        of his corner. It is not until later when the apartment owner picks up
	        the thumbtack along with Dustin, freeing him from his corner and tossing
	        him through the air. Escaped from the corner, Dustin lands in Roomba’s
	        direct path and is finally vacuumed, joining his fellow dust bunnies at
	        the nightclub located inside Roomba.

  		<h3>2. StoryBoard</h3>
  		<p>
        After brainstorming and narrowing down our ideas we decided to
        storyboard out our film. This is a series of sketches showing different
        shots and narrative beats of the film. This step helped us divide works
        among each other. For example, Andy will animate scenes 1-13 and so on.
        Here I found that my lack of drawing skills did not end up effect my
        team because we all ended up animating our own parts. Lastly, we put
        together a video with narrations of the script and each scene of the
        storyboard being shown.

    <h3>3. High Fidelity Concept Art</h3>
    <p>
     The next step of production was to create high fidelity concept art of the
     character and the environment. Since, I was not the artist of the group I did
     not patriciate in this step.

    <h3>4. Project Implementation Process</h3>
    <p>
      After brainstorming and writing our script and storyboard, our team listed
      out all assets that were required to be modeled and textured, assigning
      each member with at least one asset to create. After all the modeling and
      texturing were completed, our team then divided our storyboard into a list
      of cinematic shots and assigned each member with different shots to
      animate and render individually. I was tasked with the majority of the
      animation starting for 0:16 to 1:22 of the film. Furthermore, I was also
      tasked figuring out the fur texture of the dust.

    <h3>5. Texturing</h3>
    <p>
      I was tasked with figuring out how to texture the fury that would be on
      the dust bunnies. Which lead to the biggest issue we encountered during
      this production with xGen, the geometry instancer tool, as fur files were
      not properly transferring to different scenes on different computers. As
      we were assigned with different scenes to animate, each member needed to
      import required models into their working folders. However, when we
      attempted to import Dustin and other dust bunnies into our scene folders,
      we found that our xGen fur files would not properly transfer through. As a
      result, the fur texture did not load into different scenes.
    </p> <br>

    <p>
      To ensure that our xGen files properly transferred through to different
      scenes, we made sure to import our bunnies into our Maya files. If
      importing the file was not successful, we would then go into our xGen file
      path and manually rewrite the paths to ensure that Maya could locate the
      xGen files from the proper folder.
    </p> <br>

    <p>
      Another issue that arose with xGen was that the fur would not connect to
      our model’s mesh when when animating Dustin. The exact reason behind why
      the fur would not connect with the mesh is still unclear as not all team
      members experienced this issue. However, for times when we did encounter
      this issue, we would either restart Maya or re-import the textured model
      back into our scenes. If that was not successful, then to ensure that the
      fur would follow our model’s mesh, we copied the animation keyframes of
      the skeleton to the fur.

    <h3>6. Animating</h3>
    <p>
      Since I was tasked with a large portion of the animation, I really tried
      to follow the 12 principle of animation. One of the principles I really
      followed and tried to portrait in our film was squash and stretch. This is
      meant to give a sense of weight and flexibility to the object. This was
      especially important for this project since, there were no dialogue for
      the character, therefore, it was very important for us to convey emotions
      through animation. Another way I tired to bring life into our characters
      is through the principle, slow in and slow out. This was to hopefully show
      realistic movement between objects. Since, things in real life take time
      to accelerate and slow down. A lot of this was done in the Maya graph
      editor which provides curves to show the speed of animation. Using this
      editor, I was able to follow the 12 principle of animation.

    <h3>7. Putting it All Together</h3>
    <p>
      Once each team member has finished animating their own section, all the scenes
      were rendered and put together inside of Adobe Premiere. Where sound effects and
      background music are added. Here is our finished product.

    <h3>8. Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      This project helped me understand the power of new media tools and how it
      can be combined with traditional direction to create something that is
      impossible to shoot with a normal camera. The array of camera angles and
      movements provided by animation tools such as Maya is endless. However, by
      combining traditional cinematography techniques such as meaning behind
      each shot I learned to create a meaningful animation.
