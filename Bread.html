  		<h3>1. Film Drive by Sound</h3>
  		<p>
        As a film crew of two with two actors we were task to
        create a film that were driven by sound. My role on this
        project was direct the film and the cinematography, while
        coming up with a beat that will drive the film as well as
        some sound design. In this project we aimed to explore
        how we can use sound to drive the cinematograph, such as
        cutting on sound cues rather than cutting on action. This
        required us to make two cohesive beats out of things
        found in a restaurant, such as plates, glass and more.
        During the project we had to use various of filming
        equipment such as camera, lighting kits, tripods, dolly,
        sliders and glidecam. We also used sound recording
        equipment such as, h4n and boom mic. During the post
        processing phase, we used software such as, garage band,
        adobe premiere and audacity

  		<h3>2. StoryBoard</h3>
  		<p>
        I first started to sketch out a set of storyboards showing
        different shots, directions and audio that will be used for
        the film. This step made the day of filming and the
        editing process a lot of easier since it laid out the
        structure of the film, therefore, marking down all the
        ideas and shots making it so we would not need to
        improvise on the day of filming. Furthermore, it allowed
        us to refer to this if we are ever lost. This was one of the
        weaknesses to this project where my limited art skill
        hindered the production of the film. Since, I came up with
        the idea for the film I had to communicate my idea to my
        teammate and the actors but my sketches were too
        rudimentary to the point of confusing the people of set.

    <h3>3. Spotting Log</h3>
    <p>
      Since the natural of the project was using sound to drive
      a film it was important for us to create a spotting log.
      Here I wrote down when the sound will be played during
      the video and how each sound was recorded. Furthermore,
      this document showed the editing process used on each
      individual sound. For example, on Cue 5e, steps such as,
      reverb was added and the pitch of the original sound was
      lowered. This step was important because it showed our
      ability to record and edit sounds through.

    <h3>4. Composing</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most challenging part of this project was
      creating two beats for the video. Since, I did not have any
      experience with music production this was a learning
      process for myself. I created these beats in Garage Band.
      At first, I tried to add a multitude of instruments such as
      guitar and electric bass but soon found out with a lack of
      knowledge in music theory and cord progression creating
      a cohesive beat was going to be challenging. However,
      after experimenting with different percussion
      instruments, I was able to create two cohesive beat that
      will serve as a base line for our sound design. To clarify,
      these were beats created digitally through a program
      therefore, this will only aid us in our sound design
      question and not server as our final music track.

    <h3>5. Sound Design</h3>
    <p>
      After brainstorming how to turn each percussion sound
      into sounds that can be found in the restaurant we settled
      on these sounds. For example, we turned the kick drum
      into a slam on the table, the cymbals into chopsticks on
      plates. We made sure every component such as hand
      slamming the table and chopsticks hitting the plate were
      all shown in the film and synced up with the film. Lastly,
      we recorded these sounds and synced them with the beat.
      Here I was task with mixing and syncing one part of the
      beat. First, by importing all the sounds recorded into
      Audacity and then removing background static in each
      file. Second, start cutting and changing the playback
      speed for each sound so they match the tempo of the
      initial beat showed in figure 3. Then move each audio file
      to their corresponding location therefore, creating an
      actual beat. Lastly, add reverb and general EQ to create a
      bassier and wet sound.

    <h3>6. Shooting the Video</h3>
    <p>
      On the day of the shoot, we arrived at the location and
      set up all the camera, lighting and sound equipment.
      W hile following the storyboard, the actors took turns
      acting while I directed and filmed

    <h3>8. Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      This project really challenged me to direct a film starting from the sound
      design rather than through cinematograph. By composing a sound track
      before imaging a video took a lot of creativity and brainstorming.
      Furthermore, this project really showed me that the sound design is
      extremely important to a film and can change the whole perception and
      theme of a film.
